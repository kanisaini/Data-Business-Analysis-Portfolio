## Portfolio Projects
This section contains a list of projects with brief descriptions.

## Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie
**Code:** [Analyzing the Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie.ipynb](https://github.com/kanisaini/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/Analyzing%20the%20Factors%20Contributing%20to%20the%20Success%20of%20a%20Movie.ipynb)

**Goal:** To determine what factors contribute the most to a movie's success.

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of movies released between 1980 and 2022. The dataset included movie titles, ratings, genres, release dates, budgets, gross earnings, and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), analyzing the correlation between budget and gross earnings, and implementing Pearsonâ€™s correlation statistical analysis.

**Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, Correlation matrices, hypothesis testing, and data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, SciPy.

**Results:** Using Python functions the analysis revealed that votes and budget have the highest correlation with gross earnings, while the company has no significant correlation.

## Covid-19 Data Analysis 
**Code:**

**Goal:** To analyze COVID-19 data to derive meaningful insights, trends, and patterns. 

**Description:** This project focuses on exploring and analyzing COVID-19 datasets using Python. It includes data preprocessing, visualization, and statistical analysis to understand the spread, impact, and progression of the virus over time and across regions. The analysis emphasizes aspects like infection rates, recovery rates, mortality, and comparisons across different periods or geographical locations.

**Skills:** Data cleaning, data analysis, statistical exploration, and data visualization.

**Technology:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

**Results:**
- Created visualizations to display trends in COVID-19 cases, recoveries, and fatalities.
- Provided comparative analysis of the impact across different regions or countries.
- Delivered actionable insights into pandemic progression, aiding in public health understanding.
